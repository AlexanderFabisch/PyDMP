PyDMP
=====

This is a very simple implementation of dynamic movement primitives (DMP) in
Python. The main purpose of this implementation for me is to understand the
behavior of DMPs.

An illustrative notebook can be found
[here](https://github.com/AlexanderFabisch/PyDMP/blob/master/DMP.ipynb).

The papers that I used to implement DMPs are

* P. Pastor, H. Hoffmann, T. Asfour, S. Schaal: Learning and Generalization of
  Motor Skills by Learning from Demonstration
  [PDF](http://www-clmc.usc.edu/publications/P/pastor-ICRA2009.pdf)
* A.J. Ijspeert, J. Nakanishi, H. Hoffmann, P. Pastor, S. Schaal:
  Dynamical movement primitives: learning attractor models for motor behaviors

Travis DeWolf published some interesting articles about DMPs in his blog:

* [Part 2](https://studywolf.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/dynamic-movement-primitives-part-2-controlling-a-system-and-comparison-with-direct-trajectory-control/)
